- Widely viewed as government persecution during McCarthyism

Later Years (1954-1967):
- Continued as Director of Institute for Advanced Study
- Gave lectures worldwide on science and society
- Received numerous honors and awards
- 1963: Received Enrico Fermi Award from President Johnson
- Continued to advocate for arms control and peaceful uses of atomic energy
- Diagnosed with throat cancer in 1965
- Died February 18, 1967, at Princeton

Scientific Contributions:
- Born-Oppenheimer approximation (molecular quantum mechanics)
- Oppenheimer-Phillips process (nuclear physics)
- Theoretical work on neutron stars and black holes
